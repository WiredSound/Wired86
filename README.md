# Wired86
Wired86 is a fully-documented emulator of the Intel 8086 microprocessor. Note that this project is primarily for learning and as such lacks many features/aspects of the real 8086. In addition, the Programmable Interrupt Controller, Programmable Interval Timer, etc. required for the this emulator to boot something like a BIOS and MS-DOS are not currently, and likely will never be, implemented.
